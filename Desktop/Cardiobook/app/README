    * it's not the most streamlined app in the world
    * but everything that was required is in there
    * little side note: i tried to download a plugin to generate uml documents, but it ended up
        crashing android studio and corrupting all the files, so i re-downloaded android studio
        but my Cardiobook app wont run anymore. i tried everything but can't find the problem.
        "Cannot resolve symbol R"
    * oh also a little cheat i did: because there was no specfications on how to flag values,
        i couldn't figure out how to make text red, so i just flagged it with a "-" sign
        because entry setters take an int argument to compare to see if it's in range
